    "sobreSurgiuImpactoTitulo": "How did Impact come about?",
    "sobreSurgiuImpacto": "Impact came about with 7 people who met at the PROA Institute, a place where a programming course is offered. This course consists of carrying out a group project called Demoday where you have to make a presentation of it. From this came the idea of Impact, and we saw how much NGOs and institutions face many difficulties. Therefore, what was a project became a Startup because we know that we can transform lives and contribute to a better society.",
